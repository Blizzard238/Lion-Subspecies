                <h2>Introduction to the Barbary Lion</h2>
                <p>
                    The Barbary Lion, also known as the Atlas Lion, was once native to the mountain ranges of North 
                    Africa. This majestic lion was famed for its large size and dark mane that extended down to 
                    its belly. Sadly, the Barbary Lion is considered extinct in the wild, with the last known wild 
                    individual being shot in Morocco in the early 20th century.

                <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    Historically, the Barbary Lion inhabited the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. 
                    It adapted to both mountainous and forested habitats, thriving in the cooler, higher elevations 
                    of North Africa. However, deforestation and hunting led to its dramatic population decline.

                <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    The Barbary Lion was one of the largest lion subspecies, with males weighing up to 300 kg (660 lbs). 
                    Its distinctive dark mane, which extended down its chest and belly, made it stand out among other 
                    lions. Although extinct in the wild, some descendants of the Barbary Lion exist in captivity today, 
                    with efforts to preserve this subspecies continuing.
