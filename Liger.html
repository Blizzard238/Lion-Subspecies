                <h2>Introduction to the Liger</h2>
                <p>
                    The liger (<em>Panthera leo × Panthera tigris</em>) is a hybrid species resulting from the mating of a male lion 
                    and a female tiger. Ligers are the largest of all big cats, often significantly larger than either parent species. 
                    These hybrid animals are typically found in captivity, as lions and tigers do not share the same habitat in the wild. 
                    Ligers combine physical and behavioral traits from both lions and tigers, making them fascinating creatures.

                <h2>Habitat and Occurrence</h2>
                <p>
                    Since lions and tigers inhabit different regions, ligers do not occur naturally in the wild. They are usually born 
                    in captivity, such as in zoos or wildlife sanctuaries, where both species are kept. Ligers are bred as part of 
                    exotic animal displays or for educational purposes, although the ethics of breeding ligers have been debated.

                <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    Ligers are massive animals, with some males growing over 3.6 meters (12 feet) long and weighing more than 400 kg 
                    (900 lbs). They typically inherit a blend of characteristics from both parents: the liger may have the tawny fur 
                    of a lion with faint tiger stripes. Unlike lions, ligers do not usually grow manes. Their size makes them extremely 
                    powerful, but they are also prone to health issues due to their mixed genetics.
