                <h2>Introduction to the European Lion</h2>
                <p>
                    The European Lion (<em>Panthera leo europaea</em>) once roamed vast areas of southern Europe during the 
                    Pleistocene era. It is believed to be a close relative of modern African lions, though it eventually 
                    went extinct due to changing climates and competition with humans. The European Lion featured 
                    prominently in Greek and Roman mythology, symbolizing strength and courage in many ancient cultures.

                <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    Fossil evidence suggests that the European Lion lived in regions stretching from modern-day Spain to 
                    Italy, as well as parts of Greece. The lion adapted to a variety of environments, including forests 
                    and plains. Over time, human expansion and climate shifts led to the lion's gradual disappearance from 
                    Europe, with the last individuals believed to have lived in Greece.

                <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    While little is known about the specific appearance of the European Lion compared to modern lions, 
                    it was likely similar in size and build to todayâ€™s African lions. It had a robust frame and would have 
                    preyed on large herbivores such as deer and wild horses. The European Lion was an apex predator in its 
                    environment before its extinction around 100 BCE.
