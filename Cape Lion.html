                <h2>Introduction to the Cape Lion</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cape Lion was a subspecies of lion that once roamed the southern tip 
                    of Africa, particularly in the Cape Province of South Africa. Known for its large size and distinctive dark 
                    mane, the Cape Lion was hunted to extinction by the mid-19th century. Like other large African lions, it 
                    preyed on antelope, zebras, and other herbivores in the region's savannas and grasslands.

                <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cape Lion was native to the Cape of Good Hope region in South Africa. It thrived in the savannas and 
                    plains of the Cape Province, sharing its habitat with other large predators and herbivores. However, as European 
                    settlers expanded into the region, the lion's habitat diminished, and they were increasingly hunted for sport.

                <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cape Lion was one of the largest lion subspecies, with males sometimes exceeding 250 kg (550 lbs). Its dark 
                    mane, which extended over its shoulders and down to its belly, gave it a striking appearance. Some believe 
                    that its mane may have been even darker and more extensive than that of modern lions. Its body was muscular, 
                    and it had a broad head with a long tail ending in a dark tuft.
