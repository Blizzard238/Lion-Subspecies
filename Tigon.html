                <h2>Introduction to Tigon</h2>
                <p>
                    A **Tigon** is a hybrid offspring of a male tiger (Panthera tigris) and a female lion (Panthera leo). 
                    These unique animals combine traits from both parent species and are characterized by their striking 
                    appearance and fascinating behavior. Tigons are rarer than ligers (lion-tiger hybrids) and exhibit 
                    a blend of physical features from both lions and tigers.

                <h2>Habitat and Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    Tigons do not occur naturally in the wild, as lions and tigers inhabit different regions and ecosystems. 
                    Lions primarily live in African savannahs, while tigers are found in various habitats across Asia, including 
                    forests and grasslands. Tigons are usually bred in captivity, where they may be kept in zoos or wildlife 
                    parks. Their behavior often reflects both parental species, displaying a mix of lion-like social tendencies 
                    and tiger-like solitary behaviors.

                <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    Tigons tend to be smaller than ligers but exhibit a combination of features from both lions and tigers. 
                    They may have a striped pattern like a tiger, but with a more muted coloration that resembles a lion's 
                    tawny coat. Tigons can inherit the manes of their lion parent, though typically, these manes are less 
                    pronounced than those of male lions. Their unique appearance makes them an intriguing subject of study 
                    in hybrid vigor and genetics.
