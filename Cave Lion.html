                <h2>Introduction to the Cave Lion</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cave Lion (<em>Panthera spelaea</em>), also known as the European or Eurasian Cave Lion, roamed the cold 
                    landscapes of Europe and Asia during the Pleistocene epoch. It was one of the largest lion species to have 
                    ever lived and is often depicted in ancient cave paintings found across Europe. These majestic lions 
                    went extinct around 13,000 years ago, possibly due to climate change and hunting by early humans.

                <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    Cave Lions were found throughout northern Eurasia, inhabiting the steppes, forests, and tundras of regions 
                    that now include modern-day Europe, Russia, and parts of Asia. Their fossils have been discovered in many 
                    cave systems, leading to the species' name. They shared their habitat with other large Ice Age predators 
                    such as mammoths and saber-toothed cats.

                <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cave Lion was larger than most modern lions, with some males weighing up to 300 kg (660 lbs). Its 
                    build was muscular, with a powerful frame adapted for hunting large Ice Age prey. Unlike some of todayâ€™s 
                    lions, there is little evidence that male Cave Lions had manes, as depicted in cave art. Their large size 
                    and predatory nature made them one of the dominant hunters of their time.
